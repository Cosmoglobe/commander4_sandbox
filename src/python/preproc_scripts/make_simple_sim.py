# TOD simulation script

# Data = CMB + noise
#   Nside  = 2048
#   Lmax   = 6000
#   FWHM   = 10 arcmin
#   sigma0 = 30µK
#
# Scanning strategy = visit each pixel in order; repeat 9 times, such that final noise is 10µK/pix
#
# Split in chunks with 2^22 samples each (except for last one) = ~109 files, total of ~4GB
